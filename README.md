# home-automation-MQTT

 - ThingSpeak channel details:
    Subscribed public channel ID = 12397 (used for testing, actual data read through sensors connected to Arduino UNO)
    My Publishing public channel(write) ID = 666798

-Developed using MQTT protocol since it specialises in low-bandwidth, high-latency environments and is an ideal protocol for machine to machine (M2M) communication.

- You would need to add some extra configurations in the Arduino Software and your ThingSpeak account to make the project function as expected.
